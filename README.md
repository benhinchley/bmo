# bmo
> work on lots of repos like it was a monorepo

# WIP: This is the opposite of stable, and not complete

## Why?
cause sometimes it's more work to make a monorepo, that is
to make a tool.

```shell
$ bmo help

Commands:

  clone  Clone a repository into a new directory and add to the workspace.
